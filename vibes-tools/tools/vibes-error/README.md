# vibes-error

A library that handles errors for VIBES applications.

It exposes an extensible error type (which other applications can extend with their own custom errors and error-printers). It also exports let-syntax.


## Building and installing

This library cannot be built and installed on its own. It is a private library that is automatically built and included in other tools when they are built.
